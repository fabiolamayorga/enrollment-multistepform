# Multi-step patient enrollment form

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
This application allows the user to complete a form to retrieve its medical information.


## Functionality
The application was created with a main component called EnrollmentForm which wraps smaller components. Each smaller components represent one step of the form.

Some of the libraries used:
- Semantic UI: to add some stlying to the form
- Formik: to handle the state of the form across all the steps
- formik-semantic-ui: to combine the components from Semantic UI along with the Formik

## Scripts to run the application

In the project directory, you should run:

- `npm install`

- `npm start`

To run the test:
- `npm run test`
